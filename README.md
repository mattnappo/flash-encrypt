# flash-encrypt
Encrypt a flash drive.

# Download
You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/xoreo/flash-encrypt/releases/tag/v2.0)!

Or, you can `wget "https://github.com/xoreo/flash-encrypt/releases/download/v3.0/flash-encrypt" && chmod +x flash-encrypt` for MacOS

# Use
To use flash-encrypt, download the binary and place it wherever you want. I recommend keeping a copy on your flash drive. To use flash-encrypt, double click on it.

# Disclaimers
1.) It is very important that a flash-encrypt binary stored on a flash drive is *not* renamed to anything besides `flash-encrypt`. If the binary is renamed, it is possible that it will encrypt itself.
2.) Because macOS creates annoying `._` files on flash drives, flash-encrypt ignores these files and does not encrypt them.

# Supported OSs
Right now, only macOS is supported.
